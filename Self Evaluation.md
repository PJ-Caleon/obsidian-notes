# Goals For Term #3 A.Y. 2024 - 2025
- [ ] Schedule time must be from 9 AM to 3 PM.

# Things That Went Wrong
- Quadriceps injury
- Sleeping and resting problems
- Not advanced studying
- Ineffective studying and too much overthinking it
- Too much social media procrastination

# DLSU Current Orgs Evaluation
## Animo Squad (Maintenance)
- I feel like I spent way too much on focusing on my progress. I learned that in order to maintain sustainability I must control myself and take the time to do gymnastics. I need to put that ego away and follow what our coach and seniors requested to do. Just enjoy the process and accept the current situation.
- I noticed that all interactions are pretty much excellent. Honestly, there were no problems at all. I must be careful at all times to maintain.

## CATCH2T28
- Being in CATCH2t28 is fun but honestly it doesn't affect me so much during term #2. The schedules were okay and I believe that staying here is perfectly fine.

## CSG
- I feel like I need to communicate with the director. Honestly, I'm not feeling good with me being inactive in this org. I feel useless asf.
