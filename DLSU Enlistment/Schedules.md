# STT101A - Ocampo, Shirlee

Really nice & considerate prof. Teaches pretty well too. Gives a lot of incentives and allows various software to be used in your quizzes. Overall solid prof.

# CSMATH2 - Granario, Daryl

He's a really great prof. Very nice & considerate, would consider him one of the best profs. honestly. Soft voice, so it's a bit hard to hear him during F2F sometimes. ASMR voice during online classes, may or may not make you sleepy. He gives out handouts before every exam. He really knows what he's teaching and will connect CS topics to the ones being discussed at times. Gives out incentives too!

# STT101A
I had Sir Francis CampeÃ±a. Heâ€™s chill, knows what heâ€™s teaching and didnâ€™t give a final exam for my stats class. Just 3 f2f quizzes, online assessments, and a group project.

# CSMATH2
I had Sir Noel Fortun. Heâ€™s just like Sonia for me with what Iâ€™ve said earlier though I barely passed csmath2 with how hard it is. If youâ€™re having trouble in csmath, the tips I can give you are to do the practice exercises, listen well, and to try studying in the math dept last minute before your quizzes, that way you can study and also ask good profs for clarifications or things you donâ€™t understand. Iâ€™d recommend approaching the profs Iâ€™ve mentioned since theyâ€™re all nice and seem approachable

# STT101A
Regina Tresvalles (?) i not sure if i spelled her last name properlyÂ ![ðŸ˜­](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tdf/2/16/1f62d.png)

Her practice exercises were rlly the same as her quizzes, but just changed values hehe. I got 3.5 from her ! I cant remember the workloadÂ ![ðŸ˜­](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/tdf/2/16/1f62d.png)Â but ik oks naman and wasnt relatively heavy I think may final paper/project + presentation lang about performing stats on a dataset and afaik pwidi recorded.

She also teaches v well!


# CCPROG3

Edward Tighe & Adrian cubillas

sir ed teaches really well and grades relatively high din i think 3.5-4.0 attainable basta mageffort ka. He iz rlly kind as wellÂ ![ðŸ¥¹](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t12/2/16/1f979.png)Â he was my prof nung emptech sa shs

# STT101A 
Sir Vio Mojica if heâ€™s teaching the course this term

- fair exams

- maayos magturo

- grades fairly and points out errors in answers

- friendly and approachable personality

10/10 would recommend



# CABREROS, ANTHONY DEL CASTILLO
Nageenlist ka pa lang 4 ka na jan![ðŸ¤˜](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/td7/2/16/1f918.png)Got him for GESPORT and super bait and tropa vibes. He listens to your concerns talaga and tweaks what you're supposed to do based on your requests. Also, your scores, ranking, and wins/losses don't matter as long as you participate and attend. Perfect attendance=matic 4

# OÃ‘A, DARWIN RYAN DINAO

sir oÃ±a the best !! vv considerate and kind :)) 3.5-4.5 attainable even if ure not physically fit

# DOMINGO, JOHN PAUL RANCES
JP domingo is free 4. attend all classes and put effort everyday since he auto 100s IFF the class does the sets properly/trying to do it properly. its for your own physical activity anyway so win win.

# BARCENA, AVANGELINE M.
chillest pe prof imo, we did 2 dances only for pe1. got a 4

# OLARTE, CHRISTOPHER POGOY
took Christopher Olarte straight from PE1CARDIO, PE2FTEX, and PETHREE w/ my friends so that says a lot alr! :> i used to wear braces before for my scoliosis so some stretches were not recommended for me and heâ€™s considerate enough to let me do lighter movements, you can casually tell him lang & heâ€™ll consistently ask if you feel okay!
