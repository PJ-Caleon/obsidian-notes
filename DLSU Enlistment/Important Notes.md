## For: NACION, NELDA A.

Very magaling magturo si miss because she tries to explain the concepts as simple as possible!! She gives out assignments that have reasonable deadlines and are relatively easy to do as long as u listen sa class niya. For theÂ exams, highly possible to obtain a high score as long as you study well.

I highly suggest you obtain the software Statistica because gagamitin niyo siya (based on exp, starting from Hypothesis Testing) during discussions, sa assignments that ask you to perform HypoTesting, and sa culminating project.

Speaking of the culminating project, it's a research paper where you use secondary data and apply the different statistical tests so need talaga yung software. My suggestion? Don't cram it HAHAHAHA

Hope this helps!
