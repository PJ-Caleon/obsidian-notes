Hello! Just sharing something that might be useful during this enlistment!  
  
Iâ€™ve been working on a web app for enlistment scheduling â€” and itâ€™s now available in its early development stage!  
  
Basically, it automatically organizes your class schedules, generates a calendar, lets you compare options, and checks for conflicts using backup entries (although some of these features are still in development).  
  
ðŸ”§ For now, the working buttons are:  
â€¢ Add  
â€¢ Import  
â€¢ Export  
  
Iâ€™m already using it since Iâ€™m too lazy to manually input entries into spreadsheets ðŸ˜…  
  
ðŸ”— Try it here: https://enlistmate.vercel.app/  
  
Thanks and I appreciate the feedback!!
