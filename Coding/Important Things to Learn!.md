## ✅ When CRUD Is "Enough"

If you can do **CRUD** with a Web API:

- You understand **programming basics**
- You can use a **database**
- You know basic **integration**
- You’re using some **design patterns** and **best practices**

> ✅ This qualifies you for **entry-level backend/API developer** roles.

## 💰 If You Want Higher Pay, Learn These 4 Things

### 🛡️ 1. Authentication & Authorization
- Learn various auth methods:
  - `JWT`
  - `OAuth2`
  - `API keys`
  - `Session-based`
- 🔐 Crucial for **securing access** to your API.

---

### 🔢 2. API Versioning
- Avoid **breaking changes** for clients.
- Use versioning like:
  - `/v1/users`
  - `/api/v2/products`
- ✅ Allows **smooth API evolution** without forcing client updates.

---

### 🚫 3. API Limiting (Rate Limiting)
- Prevent **abuse and spam**.
- Protect server from **overload**.
- Tools to learn:
  - `Throttling`
  - `Quotas`
  - `Token bucket algorithms`

---

### 🔄 4. API Paradigms
Learn **when and why** to use each:

- **REST** – Traditional, resource-based
- **GraphQL** – Flexible client-side querying
- **gRPC** – Binary protocol, good for microservices
- **OData** – Queryable API, used in Microsoft stack
- **Minimal API** – Lightweight, fast setup (e.g., .NET Minimal API)

> ⚠️ Don't limit yourself to just one.
> 🎯 A good developer **picks the right tool** for the job.

## 🧩 Summary
Basic CRUD is enough to get started.  
But for **higher pay and better roles**, master:

1. Authentication & Authorization  
2. API Versioning  
3. API Rate Limiting  
4. API Paradigms
