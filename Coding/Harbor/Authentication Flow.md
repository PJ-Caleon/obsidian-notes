# Protecting Routes and Redirects
- Routes can be protected using hooks.server.ts, which runs on the server **before every page or API endpoint is resolved**. This allows you to intercept requests and redirect or deny access based on authentication or other logic. It is ideal for auth guards, logging, role-based access control, redirects based on user state.
