Guide to Job Hunting: From Fresh Grad to Employed

GRADUATES OF 2025! CONGRATS! As the school years come to an end, I want to give you tips and tricks when it comes to job hunting that will really help you in landing a job. So this was based on my experience - how I adapted to the brutal job market, how I utilized technologies, and how these tips were based on experience plus community experiences. Note that this was applied and tested, so consider it to be highly effective, and I hope that this will help you along the way.

These steps and tricks actually helped me land a job! Currently, I'm an alumni and graduate of Ateneo de Naga University batch 2023 BS Information Technology, and now I'm working as a developer/engineer for a foreign company. So I think people will recognize me here, but if so, I hope that you will not... hahaha!

RESUME MASTERY

Use the Harvard Resume Template For the resume, use the globally recognized BEST resume format which is the Harvard Resume template! Trust me, I've seen resumes na parang gawa sa Microsoft Word 2003 with Comic Sans font - please wag ganun! Stick to the professionals.

IMPORTANT Resume Tips:

• Do not add image - it's unnecessary, you're not applying for a pageant. I once saw a resume with a selfie - like, bro, this isn't Tinder!

• Image adds additional space - replace it with your information, skills section etc. That space is precious real estate!

• Make your resume ATS friendly - use Calibri, Times New Roman and Arial format! This will allow the program to recognize keywords since the program matches the fonts. I learned this the hard way when my resume with fancy fonts got auto-rejected by ATS systems.

• Include only relevant experience for the position you're applying for! Don't put your high school basketball achievements when applying for a software developer role

• IMPORTANT RULE: KEEP IT ONE PAGE! Seriously, HR people have like 6 seconds to look at your resume. If they need to flip pages, you've already lost

• Include the skills, projects that you know and you can explain! Periodt. Please do not lie, exaggerating is much better. If you're going to lie, be sure that you can back it up. I once put "Expert in Docker and Kubernetes" then couldn't answer basic containerisation questions.

• Do not add colors like pink, blue, etc. - it confuses the ATS program! Just stick with the plain old resume. Save the rainbow for your portfolio website

• Include your contact number, email so the employer can quickly contact you. Make sure your email is professional! and not something like "cutiepatootie2001@gmail.com".

MAKING YOUR PRESENCE KNOWN

Finding a job is like advertising. You must market yourself to potential employers. How do you do that?

Well, be good in what you do Upskill and give time to learn resources for the position you're targeting or the career that you want.

Make your presence known in job platforms/apps LinkedIn or Glassdoor - gawin ninyong Facebook ang LinkedIn, dun kayo mag-ingay! Post your certifications, projects, etc. Anything to market yourself. Don't be shy! Their judgments will not give you food on the table.

Cold Email I used to cold email CEOs. YES, MAKAPAL PO ANG MUKHA KO! COUNTLESS TIMES I FAILED THEIR EXAMS AND NAKAKAHIYA PERO THAT'S OKAY - LEARNING! And I just keep continuing until I found a job!

Let me tell you, I literally sent emails to startup founders at 2 AM because I was desperate. Some didn't reply (expected), some replied with auto-responses, but a few actually gave me a chance to interview! One CEO even replied "I admire your persistence" and scheduled a call. Hindi man ako naging successful sa lahat, but that one reply gave me hope and eventually led to connections that helped my career.

Nothing's wrong with shooting your shot, because in the end of the day we always have a shot, and we should always take it cause someday it will go IN! Worst case scenario? They don't reply. Best case? You get your dream job. Math is mathing!

JOB HUNTING STRATEGY

• Use job hunting sites like LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed, JobStreet, and other sites. DO NOT FOCUS ON ONE PLATFORM. Have like 3-4 accounts - it increases your chances to land a job or interview

• Add job tracker - very helpful

• DO NOT LOWBALL YOURSELF, PERIODT - It's okay to have standards but align your standards with your current skillset and experience.

• DO NOT APPLY BECAUSE YOU'RE ATTRACTED TO THE SALARY! YOU'RE A FRESH GRAD. Always focus on the company where you will grow, LEARN IMPORTANT SKILLS AND MOST OF ALL MAKE MEANINGFUL CONNECTIONS. ALWAYS GO FOR THE LEARNING AND EXPERIENCE! MONEY WILL FOLLOW!

• SET YOUR ALERT NOTIFICATIONS VIA EMAIL on LinkedIn, Indeed or JobStreet. These websites will notify you quickly for any positions that you're trying to target. Remember, the faster you apply, the faster the employer notices your resume since there's a queue

• Utilize the power of AI to find jobs much quicker

• Referrals and connections do work - try to reach out to your tita or friends

INTERVIEW SCHEDULING

• Don't forget interviews - If there's a conflict in your schedule or an emergency pops up, inform them immediately (before the day or before the hour). Shows professionalism

• If you're scheduled for an interview, select the quickest time - like 2 days before or 1 day before (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED). WHY? COMPANIES MOVE FAST, YOU HAVE COMPETITORS, THE ONES THAT ARE FAST GET THE HIGHEST CHANCE OF GETTING THE BAG

SECTION 2: BEFORE INTERVIEW

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. PRACTICE YOUR SOFT SKILLS!

Back in the day when I graduated in 2023, my soft skills needed work. I was passing first round interviews with a breeze but when it comes to explaining complex IT stuff, my explanation was vague and not clear. So in order to improve that, I needed to be confident in the way I speak and I needed to practice.

So what I did was to practice some interview questions. I used these resources on YouTube like CareerVidz and Cass Thompson Consulting. This really helped me a lot! After months of practicing, I was passing 2nd, 3rd to final round interviews. I even had 3 offers in one week!

Now you can use ChatGPT Voice Mode - much better and gives you the feeling you're talking to a real person, and it really gives you nice feedback!

I would spend 1 hour a day, and during the night I would speak to myself and practice answering questions like "I want you to introduce yourself," etc. This preparation helped me reduce my nervousness and helps me really improve how I deliver and speak. Paminsan napagkakamalan na akong baliw sabi ni mama kasi nag-sasalita ako mag-isa!

2. DON'T BE LATE

When it comes to interviews, never be late please. It shows lack of interest in the job and gives you a bad image, which hurts your chances. I've met a lot of CEOs, international and local - they value time! Time is gold. Always be early, 20 minutes earlier please! It shows interest and gives you those + points.

Funny story: I was once late by 5 minutes to an interview because of traffic (hello, Manila traffic!). The interviewer's first question was "Are you always late?" Boom, interview over in my head. I spent the rest of the 30 minutes trying to recover from that first impression. Spoiler alert: I didn't get the job. Lesson learned: Leave your house 1 hour earlier than you think you need to. Better to wait sa lobby while reviewing your notes than to arrive stressed and sweaty!

---

3. PREPARE A SCRIPT TAILORED TO THE POSITION

Always have a script prepared, familiarize it and have it minimized in your browser if ever you get nervous or pressured. Compose the script using GPT or Claude.

---

4. DO RESEARCH FOR THE POSITION YOU'RE APPLYING FOR

Research their company values, etc. It shows that you're interested in the position and gives you + points. I was once rejected because I didn't know what interview I was in since I was mass applying for jobs. Because of this, I didn't have time to research the company.

That rejection was brutal. The interviewer asked "What do you know about our company?" and I literally said "Uhm, you guys develop software?" HAHAHA! Turns out they were a fintech company specializing in blockchain solutions. The interviewer's face was priceless - parang napahiya siya for me. From that day on, I made it a point to research:

• Company history and mission • Recent news or product launches

• The specific role requirements • Even the interviewer's LinkedIn profile (not in a creepy way!)

Spend at least 30 minutes researching each company. It's the difference between sounding like you care versus sounding like you're just shotgun applying everywhere.

SECTION 3: DURING INTERVIEW

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SHOW ENTHUSIASM AND ALWAYS SMILE!

When interviewing, please do not sound like a very formal robot na parang binabasa lang yung script. You know yung mga interview na sobrang stiff? Wag ganun! Treat the interview as if parang nakikipag-usap lang sa tropa mo but in a professional way - yung may sense pero hindi nakakasama pakinggan.

Back when I was interviewing, I noticed na pag sobrang formal ko, parang hindi nila nakikita yung personality ko. So I started treating interviews like casual friendly conversations where I get to know them and they get to know me. I ask questions about their team, their challenges, their company culture - hindi lang ako yung tinatanong.

Be calm and enjoy lang talaga, don't let the pressure get in your head because interviews are not a test and not a judgment. Alam mo ba, during one of my interviews, I was so relaxed na nagtanong pa ako sa interviewer kung kamusta yung workload nila, if may overtime ba, ganun. Tapos sabi nila afterwards na they appreciated na I was genuinely curious about the role and not just desperate for any job.

It's a way for employers to grasp if you're a perfect fit for the company/position. They're not there to catch you making mistakes - they want you to succeed kasi they need someone for the role din naman!

BE HONEST

I've learned this the hard way. I was in desperation to land a job, so I put in my resume that I had the skill for this position/project. I added tech skills that I was not familiar with , and that went horribly wrong. I failed the technical exam and answered the technical questions in an embarrassing way even the senior engineers were disappointed.

The lesson? IF you don't know something, be honest. Tell them that you don't know but add that you're willing to learn and will allot time to learn. Honesty + willingness to learn > lying + getting exposed.

For example:

"Do you know how to manage a team?"

"In my experience ma'am, I haven't had the opportunity to manage a team directly yet, but I believe that every skill can be learned with proper guidance and experience. Based on the projects I've worked on as a developer, I've seen how important clear communication and proper planning are for team success. Plus, I've been working with different people in group projects and collaborative coding sessions, so I have some idea of how to work with different personalities. I know I still have a lot to learn, but I'm confident that with my technical background and willingness to learn, I can grow into that leadership role and help create an environment where everyone feels comfortable contributing their ideas."

OTHER INTERVIEW BEST PRACTICES:

• If the question was not clear, always ask them for a repeat

• Give yourself time to have like 20-30 seconds to construct your answers after the question is asked

• If you're having difficulty finishing and constructing words, please take pauses - 8 to 14 seconds

• Don't talk fast - it shows that you're nervous and your answers will not be clear

• To alleviate your nervousness - do breathing exercises, listen to music (good mood booster), or pray

• Hard truth to swallow: If you're nervous then you did not prepare enough - Kobe. Confidence is key! I used to shake during interviews, hands literally trembling while typing on my laptop during technical demos. Pero after months of practicing mock interviews and actually knowing my stuff inside-out, the nervousness disappeared. Preparation breeds confidence, confidence breeds success.

• Before starting the interview, acknowledge the interviewers greet them "Good morning! Good afternoon!" Also compliment them for doing a good job! Show gratitude by showing that you appreciate the given opportunity. Something like "Good morning po! Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity today to learn more about this position and your company. I really appreciate you taking the time to meet with me." Simple lang pero it sets a positive tone and shows na you're genuinely grateful for their time.

• Ask for feedback - One thing that I'm always grateful for is to the people who saw my flaws. I think of others' judgment, feedback and criticism as an opportunity to improve my craft and skill. Always be humble, be brutal about yourself, swallow the truth and do improve your skills and attitude

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 4: AFTER INTERVIEW

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Follow up - shows that you're interested

• Do a reflection - where are areas you can improve? Soft skill, technical skills, attitude

• Prepare for the next round - review the job description

• Pray - works every time

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 5: JOB OFFER

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

YEY YOU MADE IT! CONGRATS!

• NO CONTRACT, NO JOB - Always wait for the contract

• Review thoroughly the contract BEFORE SIGNING

• Ask questions about the contract

• Keep applying - Once they sent you a contract to sign, you send it and they acknowledged it, that's where you stop applying for jobs. Why? Companies have the power to forfeit or cancel the job offer for no reason. Better to have a backup plan.

• You can try to negotiate for desired salary if the contract does not satisfy your desired salary (NOT RECOMMENDED). You're a fresh graduate, you don't have the cards - the companies do. You don't have experience and they are hiring new grads so there's a risk. Might suggest taking the offer if it somehow has decent pay. Go for negotiation when you have experience and superb skills

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 6: REJECTION

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

"Rejection is redirection - forces us to be better and drives us to greatness"

Back then I was depressed during job hunting. For 2 weeks after graduation, I was rejected 9 times. Until it ramped up to 30+ - I was constantly being rejected that I was numb. I ate rejections for breakfast, lunch and dinner. But in those rejections, I learned to play the game, adapt to the changes and improve critical areas where I lacked. Because of rejection, I was able to improve and land a job after 2 months of search after grad.

But you know what? Each rejection taught me something. Rejection #5 taught me my portfolio needed work. Rejection #15 showed me my communication skills were lacking. Rejection #20 made me realize I wasn't targeting the right companies for my skill level. By rejection #30, I had become a completely different candidate better portfolio, clearer communication, realistic expectations, and ironically, more confident because I had nothing left to lose!

REJECTION MINDSET:

• When you're rejected, it's okay to feel heartbroken that job is not for you! The right job will come

• Do not let your ego get in the way Do not be the immature person who blames the job market and the company for not hiring them. This is immature. Instead of blaming outward things, blame yourself for how you react! This is like a stoic approach focus on what you can control, which is your response and your preparation. You can't control if they hire you or not, but you can control how well you prepare, how you present yourself, and how you learn from each experience. I used to get bitter after rejections, pero I realized na wala akong mapapala dun. Better to ask myself "What can I improve next time?" rather than "Bakit hindi nila ako kinuha?"

• You're an adult now, which means you're the CEO of your own life. You control your decisions, your effort, and your response to setbacks.

Think about it why do people choose Jollibee over McDonald's? Both serve burgers and fries, but Jollibee focused on what Filipinos actually want sweeter flavors, better service, and that homey feeling. They didn't complain that McDonald's had a head start or bigger budget. They just made themselves better and more appealing to their market. Same with you don't complain about the competition or the "unfair" job market. Focus on making yourself the better choice. What can you offer that others can't? What's your "Chickenjoy" equivalent in your field?

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FINAL THOUGHTS

Ang job hunt ay mahirap, pero every rejection teaches you something. Stay persistent, keep improving, and remember your breakthrough is just one "yes" away!

Good luck, future professionals!
