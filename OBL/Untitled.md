**Clear Everything First**

📌 Plugin Page Posting
- Clarify the process:
- Will postings go through pub requests only, or is there another process involved?
- Consult Kris and Jules for clarity and direction.

🧠 Execs – Captions & Content
Reach out to execs to:
- Ask for context behind each post
- Request visual maps, ideas, and references
- Gather thoughts and input for caption writing

🗂️ CPD – Comprehensive Program Design
- Coordinate with Program Managers:
- When should we start posting?
- Are there key dates or milestones?
- What content do we need in advance?
