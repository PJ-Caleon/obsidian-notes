- Learn how to create a technique on how to track iterations in actual code to prevent confusions. (Useful in analyzing live coding especially when tracking down sort and search algorithms).
- Learn the difference between slow and fast growth rate and determine comparisons for combined functions of search and sort algorithms.
- Learn the other growth rate functions other than the basic functions.
- Learn the worst case and best case of searching and sorting algorithms
- Learn more about logarithmic properties again.
- Learn the graph of Big-Oh, Big-Omega, and Big-Theta
- Learn how to interpret and understand what a growth rate means.
- Learn how to make techniques in analyzing algorithms (Useful for nested for loops, and other algorithms)
