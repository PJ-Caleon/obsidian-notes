# Rate of Growth

## Dominant Term
- It is a term with the fastest growth rate in the function determines the behavior of the algorithm.
- $3n^2+2n^2+1$
- $2^n+3^n +5$


# 

# Polynomial Degree
Polynomial degree $k$ dominates a plynomial of degree $m$ iff k > m

$$1 \lt \log{n} \lt n \lt n\log{n} \lt n^2 \lt n^3 \lt 2^n \lt n^n$$

For example
$$3n^3+4n^2+2$$
The dominant term is $3n^3$ and the big o notation is $n^3$ removing the coefficients.

# Growth Rate Functions

| $O(1)$            | **Constant**<br>****   |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| $O(\log_{2}{n})$  | **Logarithmic**        |
| $O(n)$            | **Linear**             |
| $O(n\log_{2}{n})$ | **Linear-logarithmic** |
| $O(n^2)$          | **Quadratic**          |
| $O(n^3)$          | **Cubic**              |
| $O(2^n)$          | **Exponential**        |


# Asymptotic Bounds
- are used to indescribe the complexity of the algorithms
- describes only the growth rates of the algorithm as the input size approaches infinity and ignoring most of the small inputs and constant factors.
- among these bounds are: **Big-Oh**, **Big-Omega**, and **Big-Theta**

Also need to check asymptotic bounds, if they are magkadikit or not?
Whether the function is upper bound or lower bound.


# O-Notation

$$6^n+2n^2+3n+8$$
Growth rate is $n^3$, while the dominant term is $6n^3$.

$$1 \lt \log{n} \lt n \lt n\log{n} \lt n^2 \lt n^3 \lt 2^n \lt n^n$$

**Big-O Range Classification**
characterizes upper bound on the asymptotic behavior of a function where a function grows no faster than a certain rate, based on the higher-order term.
$$n^3<2^n<n^n$$
