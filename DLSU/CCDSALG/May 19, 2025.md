# Frequency Count

```python
for i = 1 to n # [1]
	for j 1 to n # [2]
		for k = 1 to n # [3]
			z = z + 1 # [4]
```


```python
for k = 2 to n + 1
	for j = 3 to n - 3
		x = x + 1
```

$$\begin{align}
n + 1 - 2 + 2 = n + 1 \\ 
\end{align}
$$

```python
for i = 2 to n + 1
	for j = 3 to n - 3
		for k = 4 to n - 4
			 x = x + 1
```

$$\begin{align}
n + 1 \\ (n - 4) (n) \\ (n-6)(n-5)(n) \\ (n-7)(n-5)(n)
\end{align}$$
