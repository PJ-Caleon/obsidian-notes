# Deliverables
- Softcopy of the class diagram following UML notations (in PDF or PNG)
- Javadoc-generated documentation for proponent-defined classes with pertinent information
- Zip file containing the source code with proper internal documentation
- Test script following the format indicated in Appendix B
	- In general, there should be at least 3 categories (as indicated in the description) of test cases per method (except for setters and getters).
	- There is no need to test user-defined methods that are ONLY for screen design (i.e., no computations/processing; just print/println).
- At the very least, there should be an introductory comment and a comment before every class and every method.
