- Versatile modeling language used across various domains. Primary purpose is to provide a standardized method for visualizing the design of a system.

- It's like a blueprint in traditional engineering disciplines, UML offers graphical representation of a system architecture. It's not a programming language and it is a visual tool for system design.

- Relationship among entities in an architecture.


## Class
- a blueprint for creating objects.
- represents entities with attributes (data) and methods (behavior).

## Components of a Class

| Class Name        | Attributes                      | Methods                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Centered and bold | Variables that define the state | Functions that define the behavior |
## Visibility and Modifiers

| Public            | Private                         | Default                            | Protected |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------- |
| Centered and bold | Variables that define the state | Functions that define the behavior |           |

## Relationship between Classes

| Association       | Multiplicity                                           | Aggregation                        | Composition |     |     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------- | --- | --- |
| Centered and bold | number of occurrences in relationships between classes | Functions that define the behavior |             |     |     |


## Class Diagram Relationships

## Association and Multiplicity
Association: Line between classes
Multiplicity: 

## Aggregation vs Composition
Aggregation: Hollow diamond, parts can exist independently
Composition: Filled diamond, parts cannot exist independently
Example:
- Aggregation

## Inheritance and Dependency
Inheritance: Arrow with hollow triangle
Dependency: Dotted arrow

## Benefits of Class Diagrams
- Clarify system structure

## Drawing Class Diagrams
- Use UML tools (e.g., Lucidchart, StarUML, draw.io)
- Follow naming conventions
- Keep diagrams clean and readable
- Avoid overcomplicating relationships

## Use Cases of Class Diagrams
- Software design and architecture
- Database schema modeling

## Class Relationships
Association
Aggregation
Composition

### Classes and Objects
- Objects cannot perform much by themselves, otherwise they become god-objects which violate OOP!
- Objects should interact with each other in order to accomplish complex tasks.

### Association


### Types of Association
1. Directed
2.
