Thank you Lord for this day, for all the food that we have, for blessing my family, my friends, my colleagues, my training mates, and every one in DLSU or in my personal life. Thank you Lord for always staying by my side, for helping me through tough times, and allowing me to always have hope to survive every day. Thank you for having this life, despite of tough circumstances, without you I wouldn't be here, and I am really really grateful for it.

Allow me to apologize for all my sins, for all the mistakes that I did, and for all the temptations I have been facing. I'm sorry for everything, and I will always do my best than my previous self. 

I hope that I'll be able to talk and discuss reflections I have with you soon. Thank you Lord for this time, and for listening, I hope that everything would be alright.

For this upcoming STT101a class, and for the other students and professors in my courses. I hope that we may get to learn and do our best despite of any circumstances we face. Let this be a strength for our weaknesses, and bless us Lord with all your strength, wisdom, patience, discipline, and your love.

In the name of Jesus Christ, amen
