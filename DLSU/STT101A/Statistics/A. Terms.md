# Mean
also known as **Average**
- Adds up all the numbers, then divide by how many numbers there are.
# Variance
Tells how spread out the numbers are from the mean. It's the average of the squared difference from the mean. This expresses the consistency between each value in a data set.
- **Larger Variance** - the more data is spread out
- **Smaller Variance** - the more the data is clustered near the average

For example, when it comes to player statistics it can describe how consistent the player is when it comes to kills. It can be calculated per match.

|Match|Kills|
|---|---|
|1|10|
|2|12|
|3|9|
|4|11|
|5|8|
|6|10|
|7|13|
|8|9|
|9|11|
|10|10|
Analysis: the average of this dataset is $10.3$ kills in 10 matches and the variance is $2.01$ and the standard deviation is $1.42$ kills. 
# Standard Deviation
- It's the square root of the variance. Tells you how much data varies from the average, in the same units as the original data.
- **Low Stdev** - data is closer to the mean.
- **High Stdev** - data is spread out

# Sample and Population
- **Population** - all the data that you're interested in
- **Sample** - a small part taken from the population (used when you can't measure everything)

# Coefficient of Variation (CV)
- It's the standard deviation divided by the mean, often shown as a percentage.
- Formula is
$$
CV = \frac{\text{Standard Deviation}}{\text{Mean}} \times 100\%
$$
- It shows how big the variation is compared to the mean.
- It is useful when comparing variability between different datasets or units.
