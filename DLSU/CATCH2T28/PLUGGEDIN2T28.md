Good day, DLSU Counseling and Psychological Services! Greetings in St. La Salle! I am Bullet Fernandez, Chairperson of Student Welfare for CATCH2T28. Iâ€™m reaching out as part of our Mental Health Awareness campaign under the #PluggedIn2T28 initiative. We are hoping to feature a short interview with a representative from CPS to help shed light on mental health, particularly in the context of student life. We would like to ask if any member of your team might be available for a brief 10-minute interview sometime between Thursday, May 22 to Saturday, May 24. If possible, we would love to record the interview at the CPS office for an added sense of authenticity. However, if this is not feasible, we are open to conducting at another location that works for your team, perhaps in the USG open space. The exact schedule and interview details will be finalized and shared once availability is confirmed. Your input would be incredibly valuable in encouraging students to better understand mental health and to feel more empowered in seeking help. We believe that featuring a trusted voice like CPS will greatly help in reducing stigma and fostering a more open, supportive environment within the university. We look forward to your response and truly hope you can be part of this initiative. Warm regards, [email sig]

Good day, Br. Bernie
