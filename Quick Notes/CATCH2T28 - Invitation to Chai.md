Good afternoon, Chelsea!

I am Rin, Chairperson for Student Welfare under CATCH2T28. As part of our ongoing #PluggedIn2T28 initiative, we are preparing a short video series to honor Pride Month. We aim to highlight voices across the university who are helping create inclusive, understanding, and values-driven spaces.

We would be honored to feature you in a brief interview to share your perspective. The interview will focus on your insights as part of the LGBTQIA+ community.

We’d be happy to schedule this between Wednesday and Saturday and can accommodate your availability. It may be recorded in person or online, depending on your convenience. Looking forward to your response, and thank you for considering this meaningful collaboration.




I hope you're doing well! I'm Rin from the Student Welfare committee of CATCH2T28. This Pride Month, we’re launching a campaign called #PluggedIn2T28 that includes short interviews with students about what Pride, kindness, and belonging mean to them.

We’d be grateful to feature you in one of these videos. The interview will consist of just a short set of questions where you can share your thoughts in your own way.

If you’re open to participating, we can schedule a quick shoot sometime between Wednesday to Saturday in person, or online.

Please let me know if you're interested! We'd love to hear your voice.

Prompt:

- iniisip ko rin kung mag poprovide ba tayo ng default data ng pokemons kaso nasa isip ko ang haba kasi
- tapos inisip ko bakit mag aadd tayo ng pokemon kung pokedex sya, like why do we have the free will to do that so ang naisip ko it means we can make our own custom pokemons
- kase diba ano, isipin mo may mga pokemon tapos cry method so ang naiisip ko lagyan ng parameter ung constructor para mag pass ng cry message?

About MCO1:
1. Did you provide default initialized data of Pokemon objects? Because I realized that since we are building a Pokedex app, aren't we are going to store all those Pokemon data cause it's an encyclopedia right? But the thing is I realized that is I feel like it's too much to add all of those since there are many Pokemons there. So I was wondering if you tried to add some sample data not the whole population instead. But for me I would try to add sample data.
2. Also in the instructions, it says we are going to implement adding of Pokemons so I realized since we let the users have free will to add Pokemons, I assume that it also allows users to create custom Pokemon especially because the user for example has the free will to do so.
3. Also with the cry method, since we are allowed to create different types of Pokemon, and since the instructions doesn't mention that we are going to add "cry" argument in the Pokemon constructor, I realized that we really have to implement a way to also add it when we are creating a custom Pokemon because each Pokemon instance has its own unique cry message right?
